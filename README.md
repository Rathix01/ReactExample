ReactExample
============

An example react application generally using the flux architecture, the only major difference is that
application actors use BaconJS event streams for most of the communication.

This is meant to be used as a general demonstration of how an application built this way might work.

It is a non-trival example of how a form generation engine might work.

This application is not finished, there are no tests yet, there are probably bugs.

More updates to come.
